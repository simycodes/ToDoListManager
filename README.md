application that allow users to add, remove, and view tasks.

This program was implemented to demonstrate the C++ programming principles
learned in form of a working application. The program shows how variables,
expressions, functions, loops, classes,objects and the list data structure can
be implemented together to produce a working program, from which the mentioned
principles can be learned from in a practical way.
